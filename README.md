# EuDock 1.0

EuDock is an old project started with a bet:

"_Create a web application with the same look and feeling of the [OS X Dock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dock_(OS_X))_"

The main challenge in 2006 was to deal with Javascript v1.6 and HTML3.

After few days the first [release](https://github.com/ceccopierangiolieugenio/EuDock/tree/EuDock_1.0) was completed. The overall result was not as expected but it was good enough to start exploring new features.

# EuDock 2.0

Due to the experience acquired with [EuDock1.0](https://github.com/ceccopierangiolieugenio/EuDock/tree/EuDock_1.0) I started from scratch a new more object oriented implementation with better event handling and new features:
